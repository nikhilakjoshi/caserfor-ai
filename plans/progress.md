# Progress Log

## 2026-01-25: Prisma ORM Setup

### Completed
- Installed prisma@7.3.0 and @prisma/client@7.3.0
- Installed @prisma/adapter-pg and pg for Prisma 7 adapter pattern
- Created prisma/schema.prisma with full data model (User, Vault, Document, Workflow, WorkflowStep, Prompt, Example, AssistantQuery, SourceReference, HistoryEntry, StarredItem)
- Created prisma.config.ts for Prisma 7 configuration
- Created lib/db.ts with PrismaClient singleton using pg adapter
- Added npm scripts: db:generate, db:push, db:migrate, db:studio
- Created .env.example with DATABASE_URL template

### Notes for next dev
- Prisma 7 uses adapter pattern - no url in schema.prisma, connection via pg Pool in lib/db.ts
- Run `npm run db:push` or `npm run db:migrate` after setting DATABASE_URL to create tables
- StarredItem uses itemId string field (not polymorphic relations) - app code handles lookup
- All models from prd/schema.prisma ported with minor adjustments for Prisma 7 compatibility

### Blocked
- "Verify database connection works" step requires actual PostgreSQL instance
