1. Find the highest-priority feature to work on and work only on that feature. \
This should be the one YOU decide has the highest priority - not necessarily the first in the list. \
2. Check that the types check via npm run typecheck and that the tests pass via npm run test. \
3. Update the PRD with the work that was done. \
4. Append your progress to the @plans/progress.md file. \
Use this to leave a note for the next person working in the codebase. \
5. Use the 'npm run typecheck' command to check that the there are no type issues. \
6. Make a git commit of that feature. \
ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE FEATURE. \
7. Any assumptions you make, appent them to the @plans/assumptions.md file. \
If, while implementing the feature, you notice the PRD is complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>. \
